# Projection Studio for Web

Created for the Shutterfest 2023 class titled "Projection Shootout", Projection Studio for Web is a tool for photographers to use with light projection photoshoots. The app can display various geometric patterns as well as images, which can be rotated, scaled, and tiled.

## About

* This app only runs on desktop browsers.
* I develop and test on Chrome for macOS, but it should work on Windows. Let me know if that's not the case!
* The app consists of the primary window (index.html), along with a second browser window that will pop up. This second window contains a Canvas where all of the graphics are drawn.

## Usage

1. Connect a projector to your computer
2. Make sure the displays are configured to treat the projector as a separate display
3. When the app pops up the secondary browser window, drag that window to the projector display and maximize it
4. Now you can navigate from screen-to-screen using the list on the left side.
